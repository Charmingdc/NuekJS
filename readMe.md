### ⚙️ Installation

Run the following to get started:

```bash
npm install nuekjs
```

Or use the available **CDN** https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/nuekjs@latest/scripts/main.js:

```html
<!-- CDN usage example -->
<script type="module">
  const component1 = new NuekComponent(componentSelector, nuekFilePath, optionalProps, loop, condition);
</script>
```

---

### 📁 Component Setup (`.nuek` files)

To begin, create `.nuek` files — each file contains a single self-contained component.

**Format:**

```html
<script>
  // JavaScript logic
</script>

<component>
  <!-- Your HTML here -->
</component>

<style>
  /* Component-specific CSS */
</style>
```

**⚠️ NOTE:** Please **strictly follow** the format above for consistent behavior.

---

### 💡 Usage in HTML

```html
<!-- Import your .nuek component like this -->
<script type="module">
  let show = true;
  const myComponent = new NuekComponent("#app", "/components/Card.nuek", {
    title: "Hello",
    content: "This is from NuekJS!"
  }, 1,show);
</script>
```
